title: Nix for macOS… and NixOS… in one flake
subtitle: Presented as a Lightning Talk during Planet Nix 2025
tags: [nix, macos, nixos]

This is the lightning talk I gave at [Planet Nix](https://planetnix.com) 2025 on a whim since they were looking for more speakers. It touches on the various things I currently mange with [Nix](https://nixos.org) on my macOS laptop and some of the extra things I manage on NixOS machines.

For context, Planet Nix is co-located with [SCaLE 22x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/22x).
